================================

Stupid BASIC interpreter written in rust because I needed one. Yes I know, many exist, but I just couldn't find one in the Arch AURs so I just made one myself. It is most certainly not a serious project, don't attack me.

USAGE:
-----
```
    $ sBASIC [FILE]
# Example
	$ sBASIC res/Hello.bas
	$ sBASIC res/Fibonacci.bas
```

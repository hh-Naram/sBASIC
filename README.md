Stupid BASIC interpreter written in rust because I needed one. Yes I know, many exist, but I just couldn't find one in the Arch AURs so I just made one myself. It is most certainly not a serious project, don't attack me.

## Usage
```sh
$ sBASIC [FILE]
```
Examples are located in the `res/` directory:
```sh
$ sBASIC res/Hello.bas
$ sBASIC res/Fibonacci.bas
```
